# PaTai's CookBook 

Created by **Patrick Dacius**, and **Taifinkaba Chowdhury**.

## üöÄ Mission statement

  - Description of endpoint: Search for the meal by meal name. 
  - List of data values used by the endpoint: For each meal, we will retrieve a list of information starting with `id` and `name`
- API endpoint #2 - www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/list.php?i=list
